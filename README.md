  ## Installation
  To use this API, copy and clone the GitHub repository to your local computer and open it in your text editor of choice. You will want to have MongoDb, Mongoose, and Express installed to run this application. Additionally, install the node modules by running 'npm install' in the terminal. To run the application, run an 'npm start' in the terminal. To test that the API and all the routes are working, use Insomnia or a similar program. Attached to this README is a walk-through video showing all of the routes in Insomnia.
